_LAMBDA FUNCTION_

A lambda function is a small anonymous function. A lambda functioncan 
take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.
Lambda functions are used when you need a function for a short period of
time. This is commonly used when you want to pass a function as an
argument to higher-order functions, that is, functions that take other 
functions as their arguments.
